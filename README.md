## Summary
I am a software engineer and data analyst with over a decade of experience designing and delivering high-impact systems across agriculture, healthcare, and technology. I specialize in transforming complex technical challenges into practical, scalable solutions—whether that’s architecting agentic AI systems, modelling large-scale data for predictive insight, or developing secure, end-to-end blockchain and NLP applications.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Sydney, where my research focuses on blockchain network resilience and the security of decentralized infrastructures. My goal is to bridge research and engineering by transforming academic findings into real-world tools and systems that strengthen the reliability and scalability of blockchain ecosystems.

My background spans backend development for enterprise telecommunications, IoT analytics for fleets and solar PV systems, and academic teaching in software and data design. I thrive in cross-disciplinary teams, collaborating with business, research, and operations stakeholders to translate technical innovation into measurable impact. I remain committed to continuous improvement—in both technology and research—with a focus on creating meaningful, real-world impact.
