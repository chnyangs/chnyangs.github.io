## Summary
I’m a software engineer and data analyst with over 10 years of experience building high-impact systems across multiple sectors — including agriculture, healthcare, and technology. I specialise in transforming complex technical challenges into actionable business outcomes: whether that’s designing agentic AI systems, modelling large-scale data for predictive insights, or building and integrating blockchain and NLP solutions.

My background spans backend development for large-scale telecommunications platforms, telemetry and IoT-driven analytics for fleets and solar PV farms, and academic teaching in software, data and systems design. I thrive on cross-disciplinary work — collaborating with stakeholders in business, operations and research to deliver prototypes and dashboards that enable data-driven decision-making.

Currently, I’m focused on leveraging my skills in blockchain (Rust, Solidity, on-chain/off-chain integration), prompt engineering and system security to build next-gen platforms that bridge real-world assets, decentralized infrastructure and enterprise applications.

I’m committed to continuous improvement—both in technology and research—with a focus on impact-driven work.
